### + What does a doctype do?
```
Document Type Declaration (DTD)

Validation Testing
- It tells the HTML validator which version of (X)HTML standard the web page coding is supposed to comply with. It'll check your code against the specified standard.

Browser
- It tells the browser how to render the page in standards-compliant mode.

If no DOCTYPE declaration or incorrect:
- Cannot use HTML validator as it requires a DOCTYPE declaration.
- Browser renders the webpage in `Quirks Mode`.
- Stylesheet may not be implemented as planned.
